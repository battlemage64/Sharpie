{"workshopId":2178955679,"Title":"Sharpie","Description":"This mod adds a Sharpie that can write graffiti on walls, furniture, items, and creatures! You can set its color or make it a random color. You can get it by trading with Q Girl (she has five of them and is willing to share!). You can even use it to change an object's appearance color, like a box of crayons.\n\nThe Sharpie is a 0-weight, 0-cost artifact trinket (it shows up as \"small tube\" before examination). It's currently only obtainable from Q Girl or wishes.\n\nPlanned features:\n-special picture characters (like in randomly-generated graffiti)\n-custom colored text patterns (like in artifacts and some adjectives)\n\nPlease comment any suggestions or bugs!","Tags":"Item,Items,Silly,Caves of Qud,Color,Cosmetic","Visibility":"2","ImagePath":"preview.png"}
