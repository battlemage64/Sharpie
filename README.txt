This mod adds a Sharpie that can write graffiti on walls, furniture, items, and creatures! You can set its color or make it a random color. You can get it by trading with Q Girl (she has five of them and is willing to share!). You can even use it to change an object's appearance color, like a box of crayons.

The Sharpie is a 0-weight, 0-cost artifact trinket (it shows up as "small tube" before examination). It's currently only obtainable from Q Girl or wishes.

Use the Change Color option to set the color to any color character, or type a pattern of colors. You can find color characters here: https://cavesofqud.gamepedia.com/Modding:Text_Color_Codes_%26_Object_Rendering
Once you write something, it will have that color or pattern. Leave the color field blank for a random color.

Set the pen color to E to erase graffiti written on walls.

You can type special characters with \u. Just type \u00XX, where X is a hexadecimal digit. More info here: https://cavesofqud.gamepedia.com/Modding:Code_page_437
